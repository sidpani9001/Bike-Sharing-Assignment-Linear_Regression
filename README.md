# Bike-Sharing-Assignment-Linear_Regression

BoomBikes, a prominent US bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue declines amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To navigate this challenging market environment and revitalize their business, they've engaged a consulting firm. The primary objective is to uncover the key factors influencing the demand for their shared bikes in the American market once economic conditions stabilize post-lockdown.

Objectives
The consulting firm aims to achieve the following:

Identify Significant Variables: Determine which variables play a crucial role in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

Evaluate Predictive Power: Assess how effectively these variables explain variations in bike demand.

Approach
To address these objectives, the consulting firm will employ Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis. This statistical technique allows us to explore the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable (bike demand in this case).

Key Steps
Data Collection and Preparation: Gather relevant data on factors potentially influencing bike demand, such as weather conditions, seasonal variations, economic indicators, etc.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough EDA to understand the distributions, correlations, and preliminary insights from the data.

Model Building: Develop an MLR model where the demand for shared bikes (dependent variable) is modeled as a linear combination of independent variables (e.g., temperature, humidity, seasonality indicators).

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and p-values to determine the significance and strength of each predictor variable.

Interpretation: Interpret the coefficients of the model to understand the direction and magnitude of the impact each variable has on bike demand.

Expected Outcomes
Upon completion of the analysis, BoomBikes and the consulting firm anticipate:

Identification of Key Drivers: Clear identification of significant factors influencing bike demand.
Insights for Strategic Planning: Insights to formulate targeted strategies to boost revenue post-lockdown.
Recommendations: Data-driven recommendations to optimize bike availability, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts.
Conclusion
Through rigorous analysis using Multiple Linear Regression, BoomBikes aims to gain actionable insights into the dynamics of bike demand. This proactive approach will equip them with the necessary tools to navigate the current market challenges effectively and accelerate growth once economic conditions improve.
